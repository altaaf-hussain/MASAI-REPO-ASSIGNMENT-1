Hello,i am Altaaf Hussain.Currently i am studiying in masai.Today i am going to share my expreince about masai.

After completing my graduation (bachleor of science)

I have no idea what should i do someone one told me if you are good in maths than you should try in coding.

basically i used teach maths dduring my graduation journey.so i starded watching the video on youtube.

and I notice one thing coding  is nothing but its all about maths and logic.so i learned python and html and css from youtube.

and now i need a platform which guide me and provide a job.i watch the video about masai on youtube when i research about masai on quora.

there are lots of comment.finally i decided to join masai. main thing i learn in masai how to manage your time.and before joining my communication skill 

is not so good but now i noticed i  improvemed  my communication.and i learn lots of thing basically coding and DSA.
